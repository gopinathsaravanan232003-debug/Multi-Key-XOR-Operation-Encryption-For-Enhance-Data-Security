# Multi-Key-XOR-Operation-Encryption-For-Enhance-Data-Security
The Multi-Key XOR Operation Encryption project is a lightweight yet effective data security mechanism that improves upon traditional XOR encryption by using multiple keys instead of a single static key. This approach increases resistance to brute-force and frequency analysis attacks, making it suitable for securing sensitive information in low-resource environments.


In this method, plaintext data is encrypted by sequentially applying the XOR operation with different keys in multiple rounds. Each round uses a separate key, and the keys can be generated dynamically or sourced from a secure key management system. The decryption process simply reverses the XOR operations using the same keys in reverse order.
